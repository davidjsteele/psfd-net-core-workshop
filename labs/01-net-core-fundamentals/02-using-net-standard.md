# Lab Guide - Using .NET Standard

## Prerequisites
* **Operating System:** Windows
* **Software:** Visual Studio 2017 or 2019.

## Exercise 1 - Reference .NET Standard from .NET Core

### Steps

1. Return to your console, create a Visual Studio Solution with a couple of new projects.

    ```bash
    cd C:\Dev\dotnet-workshop\
    mkdir DotNetStandard
    cd .\DotNetStandard\
    dotnet new sln

    dotnet new classlib --name DiscountCalculator.Core
    dotnet sln add .\DiscountCalculator.Core\
    
    dotnet new api --name DiscountCalculator.API
    dotnet sln add .\DiscountCalculator.API\
    ```

2. Add a project reference too:

    ```bash
    dotnet add DiscountCalculator.API reference .\DiscountCalculator.Core\
    ```

3. Open the solution (.sln) file in Visual Studio. For each project, open it's project file. Note that they are targeting "netstandard2.0" and "netcoreapp2.2" respectively.

4. Let's add some code. In *DiscountCalculator.Core* replace *Class1.cs** with "DiscountEngine.cs"

    ```c#
    using System;

    namespace DiscountCalculator.Core
    {
        public class DiscountEngine
        {
            public double GetDiscountAmount(DateTime dateJoined)
            {
                var diff = DateTime.Today - dateJoined;

                switch ((int)Math.Floor(diff.TotalDays / 365))
                {
                    case 0:
                        return 0;
                    case 1:
                        return 0.1;
                    case 2:
                    case 3:
                    case 4:
                        return 0.15;
                    case 5:
                        return 0.2;
                    default:
                        return 0.3;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

5. In *DiscountCalculator.API* replace *ValuesController.cs** with "DiscountsController.cs"

    ```c#
    using System;
    using DiscountCalculator.Core;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

    namespace DiscountCalculator.API.Controllers
    {
        [Route("api/discounts")]
        [ApiController]
        public class DiscountsController : ControllerBase
        {
            [HttpGet]
            public ActionResult<double> Get(DateTime dateJoined)
            {
                var engine = new DiscountEngine();
                var discount = engine.GetDiscountAmount(dateJoined);
                return discount;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    > **Note:** In the next module, we'll explore how to improve this with *depenedency injection*.

6. Run your web application from Visual Studio. Make a web request to "/api/discounts?dateJoined=2017-05-01" and the service will return the permitted discount.

## Exercise 2 - Reference .NET Standard from .NET Framework

### Steps

1. In Visual Studio, right click the solution and select **Add -> New Project**. Look for the project type "Console Application (.NET Framework)". Call it "DiscountCalculator.CLI"

    > **Note:** For the purpose of this exercise ensure you select .NET Framework and C#.

2. Right click the new project and select **Add -> Reference**. Select the project "DiscountCalculator.Core".

3. Update *Program.cs* with:

    ```c#
    using DiscountCalculator.Core;
    using System;

    namespace DiscountCalculator.CLI
    {
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                var discountEngine = new DiscountEngine();

                while (true)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Enter date joined:");
                    var input = Console.ReadLine();

                    DateTime dateJoined;
                    if (!DateTime.TryParse(input, out dateJoined))
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine($"Invalid input: '{input}'.");
                    }

                    var discount = discountEngine.GetDiscountAmount(dateJoined);
                    Console.WriteLine($"Available discount: {discount * 100}%");
                }


            }
        }
    }
    ```

4. Run your console application from Visual Studio.

5. You now have a .NET Standard library, that is being referenced by a ASP.NET Core Web API project and a .NET Framework Console app. "DiscountCalculator.Core" can be used anywhere that implements "netstandard2.0":

    * .NET Core 2.0
    * .NET Framework 4.6.1
    * Mono 5.4
    * Xamarin.iOS 10.14
    * Xamarin.Mac 3.8
    * Xamarin.Android 8.0
    * Universal Windows Platform 10.0.16299
    * Unity 2018.1
    * And more!
