# Lab Guide - Dependency injection 

## Exercise 1 - ASP.NET Core Built-in Dependency Injection
In this lab you will:
* Configure service mapping with different lifetimes using the ASP.NET Core framework built-in features
* Inject service dependencies in a Web API controller

### Steps

1. In Visual Studio, create a new ASP.NET Core Web API project. 

2. Create a code file with name *OperationInterfaces.cs*

3. Add a base ```IOperation``` interface with an ```OperationId``` property.

    ```c#
    public interface IOperation
    {
        Guid OperationId { get; }
    }
    ```

4. Add two derived interfaces. We will later register them with different lifetimes. 

    ```c#
    public interface IOperationScoped : IOperation
    {
    }

    public interface IOperationSingleton : IOperation
    {
    }
    ```

5. Open the ```ValueController``` class. Add a field declarations for the two services:

    ```c#
    private readonly IOperationScoped _scopedOperation;
    private readonly IOperationSingleton _singletonOperation;
    ```

6. Add a constructor that takes these interfaces as parameters:

    ```c#
    public ValuesController(IOperationScoped scopedOperation, IOperationSingleton singletonOperation)
    {
        _scopedOperation = scopedOperation;
        _singletonOperation = singletonOperation;
    }
    ```

7. Implement the ```Get()``` action to return the two services so that we can more easily test their ```OperationId``` values.

    ```c#
    [HttpGet]
    public ActionResult<Dictionary<string, IOperation>> Get()
    {
        return new Dictionary<string, IOperation>()
        {
            { "Scoped", _scopedOperation },
            { "Singleton", _singletonOperation }
        };
    }
    ```

8. Create a new class with name ```Operation``` as shown here:

    ```c#
    public class Operation : IOperationScoped, IOperationSingleton
    {
        public Operation()
        {
            OperationId = Guid.NewGuid();
        }

        public Guid OperationId { get; private set; }
    }
    ```

    > **Note:** This class implements both interfaces: ```IOperationScoped``` and ```IOperationSingleton```.

9. Open *Startup.cs*. Add the service registrations:

    ```c#
    services.AddScoped<IOperationScoped, Operation>();
    services.AddSingleton<IOperationSingleton, Operation>();
    ```

10. Run the app. And make a request to */api/values*

11. Refresh the browser to create multiple requests and observe the behaviour of the services with different lifetimes.

12. **Bonus task** (if you have time): Play with different registration methods and overloads in ```Setup.ConfigureServices``` and observe the resulting behaviour.

## Exercise 2 - Autofac with ASP.NET Core
In this lab you will:
* Convert the project created in Exercise 1 to use Autofac instead of the built-in DI framework

### Steps

1. Open the Visual Studio project from the previous exercise.

2. Add the Autofac NuGet package and its extension for ASP.NET Core. The packages are:

    * Autofac
    * Autofac.Extensions.DependencyInjection

3. Add Autofac support to the WebHost build pipeline in *Program.cs*.

    1.	Add ```using Autofac.Extensions.DependencyInjection;```
    2.	Add ```AddAutofac``` in ```BuildWebHost``` as following:

        ```c#
        public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
                WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                    .ConfigureServices(services => services.AddAutofac())
                    .UseStartup<Startup>();
        ```
        
4. Add Autofac support to *Startup.cs*.

    1. Add the ```ConfigureContainer``` method as following (you will create the DefaultModule class later in this exercise):

        ```c#
        public void ConfigureContainer(ContainerBuilder builder)
        {
            builder.RegisterModule(new DefaultModule());
        }
        ```

    2. Resolve any missing ```using``` directives.

    3. Remove the old service mapping registrations from *Startup.cs*.

        ```c#
        services.AddScoped<IOperationScoped, Operation>();
        services.AddSingleton<IOperationSingleton, Operation>();
        ```
    4. Create the Autofac registration module. Create a class named ```DefaultModule``` and define it as following:

        ```c#
        public class DefaultModule : Module
        {
            protected override void Load(ContainerBuilder builder)
            {
                builder.RegisterType<Operation>().As<IOperationScoped>()
                    .InstancePerLifetimeScope();
                builder.RegisterType<Operation>().As<IOperationSingleton>().SingleInstance();
            }
        }
        ```

    5. Resolve any further missing ```using``` directives.
    
    6. Run the app. It should continue to work - the same as previously.
